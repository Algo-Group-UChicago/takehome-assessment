# OPTION 1 - FIND DUPLICATE
# DO NOT SHARE

from typing import List

# Implement a function to identify a duplicate integer in an unsorted array
# of integers. Talk about time/space complexity for each method you implement.

# `input` contains exactly N+1 numbers
# `input` elements are integers in the domain [1, N]
#  `input` contains all integers in the domain [1, N] at least once
def findDuplicate(input: List[int]) -> int:
