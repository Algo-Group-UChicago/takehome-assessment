# Assessment for Algo Group Uchicago
- In this assignment, we are looking for solutions that are efficient, demonstrate high quality code, and are production ready. 
- Answer any **ONE** of the questions of your choice, include testing you ran on code, and _briefly_ explain the reasoning behind your solutions. 
- Any coding language is acceptable so long as we can easily verify that your solutions are correct (the example files are C++, you need not use/follow them at all).

## Steps to follow
1. Clone this repo.
2. In README.md, delete this content and clearly state which question you are answering at the top.
3. Add your reasoning/methodology.
4. Delete all irrelevant files, and attach your solution.
5. If possible, attach proof that the tests you ran are passing (proof of correctness) in the repo.
6. Make the repo public and attach a link in the application form for us!
