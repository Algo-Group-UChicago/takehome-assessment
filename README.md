# Algo Group UChicago Assessment (READ UNTIL END)
- In this assignment, we are looking for solutions that are efficient, demonstrate high quality code, and are production ready. 
- Answer any **ONE** of the questions of your choice, include testing you ran on code, and _briefly_ explain the reasoning behind your solutions. 
- Any coding language is acceptable so long as we can easily verify that your solutions are correct (the example files are in C++/Python, but you need not use/follow them at all).
- We are NOT looking for elaborate write-ups or hundreds of lines of code, nor do we want you to spend more than 3 hours on this. We just want to get a feel for your technical abilities, thoroughness at a glance, and general approach to problem solving!

## Questions
Note: we don't have a preference for which problem you solve, but our evaluation of tougher tasks will be more lenient. Simply follow the instructions for the question you choose.

### Option 1: FIND DUPLICATE
- Implement a function to identify a duplicate integer in an unsorted array
- Given an array of exactly $N+1$ numbers, where each of the numbers in range $[1,N]$ appears at least once, find the number that appears more than once (it can be proven that exactly 1 duplicate exists).
- Analyzing the performance of your solution(s).
- Write tests and attach their results in the repo to prove correctness.
- See [option1.cpp](./find-duplicate/option1.cpp) / [option1.py](./find-duplicate/option1.py) to get started (note that you may use any language, test frameworks, file structures, etc.) so long as your completion of the task is clear.

### Option 2: IMPLEMENT STACK (HARDER)
- Implement an integer stack WITHOUT containers (list, vector, array, etc.).
- It should have methods:
  - `push` adds a given value to the top
  - `pop`  returns and removes the value at the top
  - `peek` returns the value at the top
  - `size` returns the count of values in the stack
- Write tests and attach their results in the repo to prove correctness.
- See [option2.cpp](./implement-stack/option2.cpp) to get started (note that you may use any language, test frameworks, file structures, etc.) so long as your completion of the task is clear.

### Option 3: GREEN SCREEN (HARDEST)
- See [option3.cpp](./green-screen/option3.cpp) for details.
- Write tests and attach their results in the repo to prove correctness.

## Steps to follow
1. Clone this repo.
2. In README.md, delete this content and clearly state which question you are answering at the top.
3. Add your reasoning/methodology for said question.
4. Delete all irrelevant files, and attach your solution along with any tests you may have written.
5. If possible, attach proof that the tests you ran are passing (proof of correctness) in the repo.
6. Make the repo public and attach a link in the application form for us!

## Good luck!
We don't expect you to know everything coming into Algo Group, and this is just meant to emulate a light takehome that you might recieve in the recruitment process. Even if you can't implement a full solution in a couple hours, definitely submit what you have, as we value commitment and enthusiasm over everything.
