# OPTION 1 - FIND DUPLICATE
# DO NOT SHARE

from typing import List

# Implement a function to identify a duplicate integer in an unsorted array
# of integers. Implement your solution in 2 ways if possible, and talk about
# time/space complexity for each way.

# `input` contains exactly N+1 numbers
# `input` elements are integers in the domain [1, N]
#  `input` contains all integers in the domain [1, N] at least once
